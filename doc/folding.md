# Folding Feature Implementation

## Overview
Ctrl+Period toggles folding of the current line. When a line is folded, any lines below it that are more indented (based on leading tab characters) become hidden until a line with equal or less indentation is encountered.

## Implementation Plan

### Scene (scene.ts)
[ ] Add `fold: boolean` and `visible: boolean` properties to `RowData` class
[ ] Add method to calculate indentation level of a row (count leading tabs)
[ ] Add method to identify which rows should be toggled when folding/unfolding
[ ] Return change specification indicating which rows changed visibility

### Editor (editor.ts)
[ ] Restructure row element: `<div><span class="fold-indicator"></span><span class="content" contenteditable="true">...</span></div>`
[ ] Update content getters/setters to work only with content span
[ ] Add methods to query/update fold indicator element
[ ] Add `addAfter(referenceRow, rows[])` for bulk row insertion
[ ] Add `deleteAfter(referenceRow, count)` for bulk row deletion
[ ] Update caret/offset logic to work within content span only

### View (view.ts)
[ ] Add `C-.` (Ctrl+Period) case to keyboard handler
[ ] Implement `handleToggleFold()` function
[ ] Query Scene for fold calculation
[ ] Apply visibility changes to Editor (add/remove DOM elements)
[ ] Update fold indicator display

### CSS (ambit.css)
[ ] Style for fold indicator span (fixed width, inline-block)
[ ] Icons/characters for folded vs foldable states

## Edge Cases (Deferred)
[ ] **Editing folded content**: How do insert/delete operations behave when rows are hidden?
[ ] **Navigation through folds**: Should ArrowUp/ArrowDown skip hidden rows automatically?
[ ] **Folding nested structures**: Multiple levels of folding
[ ] **Saving fold state**: Should fold state persist across sessions?
[ ] **Search/replace in folded content**: Should operations affect hidden rows?
[ ] **Copy/paste with folds**: What gets copied when rows are hidden?

## Technical Notes
[ ] Model remains unchanged (no fold state)
[ ] Scene tracks fold/visible state per row
[ ] Hidden rows removed from DOM but remain in Scene
[ ] Tabs in Scene are standard `\t`, VISIBLE_TAB `â†’` only in Editor display
[ ] Indentation logic lives in Scene, not Editor
[ ] Only rows BELOW current row can be hidden (current row never hidden by its own fold)

## Implementation Complete

## Bug Fixes 

### (Sync Issues)

**Problem**: Editor changes weren't being synced to Scene, causing:
[ ] Fold indicators not updating when indentation changed
[ ] Fold operations using stale Scene data
[ ] Tab insertions not reflected in Scene

**Solution**:
1. Created `editorInput()` handler that:
   [ ] Syncs all editor content to scene (`syncAllRowsToScene()`)
   [ ] Updates all fold indicators (`updateAllFoldIndicators()`)
   [ ] Updates wikilinks
2. Updated all edit handlers to sync to scene:
   [ ] `handleTab` [ ] now syncs tab insertion and updates fold indicators
   [ ] `handleEnter` [ ] properly converts tabs and updates fold indicators
   [ ] `handleBackspace` [ ] syncs deletions and updates fold indicators
3. Changed event listener from `View.links` to `View.editorInput` for comprehensive sync

### Changes Made

#### Scene ([[src/scene.ts]])
[x] Added `fold: boolean` and `visible: boolean` properties to `RowData` class (default: false, true)
[x] Added `getIndentLevel()` method to count leading tabs
[x] Added `toggleFold(rowId)` method that:
  [x] Calculates which rows should be affected based on indentation
  [x] Toggles fold state on the target row
  [x] Updates visibility of child rows
  [x] Returns array of affected rows

#### Editor ([[src/editor.ts]])
[x] Restructured row elements: `<div><span class="fold-indicator"></span><span class="content" contenteditable="true">...</span></div>`
[x] Updated `RowData` class with:
  [x] `getContentSpan()` and `getFoldIndicatorSpan()` helper methods
  [x] Modified `content` getter/setter to work only with content span
  [x] Added `setFoldIndicator(indicator)` method
  [x] Updated caret positioning methods (`setCaretInRow`, `offsetAtX`, `focus`) to work within content span
[x] Updated `createRowElement()` to create structured row with both spans
[x] Updated `addBefore()` to set content in content span
[x] Updated `getCurrentParagraph()` and `getCurrentParagraphWithOffset()` to navigate DOM structure correctly
[x] Updated `setCaretInParagraph()` to work with content span
[x] Updated `data` to extract text only from content spans
[x] Added bulk operations:
  [x] `addAfter(referenceRow, rows[])` [ ] insert multiple rows efficiently
  [x] `deleteAfter(referenceRow, count)` [ ] remove multiple rows efficiently

#### View ([[src/view.ts]])
[x] Added `C-.` (Ctrl+Period) keyboard handler
[x] Implemented `handleToggleFold(currentRow)`:
  [x] Calls Scene to calculate fold changes
  [x] Updates fold indicator on current row
  [x] Removes/adds DOM rows based on fold state
  [x] Restores focus after operation
[x] Implemented `updateFoldIndicator(editorRow, sceneRow)`:
  [x] Checks if row has indented children
  [x] Sets indicator: `+` (folded), `-` (foldable), ` ` (no children)
[x] Updated `setEditorContent()` to:
  [x] Only render visible rows
  [x] Set fold indicators on initial load

#### CSS ([[css/ambit.css]])
[x] Added `.fold-indicator` styles:
[x] Added `.content` styles for proper white-space handling
[x] Updated focus styles to work with new structure using `:has()` selector
